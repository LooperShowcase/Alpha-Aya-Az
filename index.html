      <br />Real Madrid Club de Fútbol, commonly referred to as Real Madrid, is
      a <br />Spanish professional football club based in Madrid who have been
      playing <br />
      in La Liga since 1929. Founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club
      <br />
      has traditionally worn a white home kit since its inception. Real Madrid
      <br />
      was recognised as the best football club of the 20th century by FIFA and
      <br />as the best European club during the same timeframe by the IFFHS,
      whilst <br />also receiving the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit in
      2004.Real Madrid has <br />the highest participations in the European
      Cup/Champions League , <br />
      tournament in which they hold the overall record for the most wins, most
      <br />draws and most goals scored. Real Madrid is the only club to have
      won <br />
      three consecutive titles (three-peat) in the European Cup/Champions League
      <br />twice, firs in all competitions. As of March 2023, Real Madrid are
      ranked <br />
      fifth in the UEFA club rankings in 1955–56, 1956–57, and 1957–58, and
      <br />second in 2015–16, 2016–17, and 2017–18. In May 2022, they won a
      <br />
      record-extending fourteenth Champions League title (the fifth in nine
      <br />seasons), recognized by the Guinness World Records .Real Madrid is
      the <br />first club across all of Europe's top five leagues to win 100
      trophies On <br />
      1 June 2009, Florentino Pérez regained Real Madrid's presidency amid the
      <br />
      outrage over the club's decline. [82][83] Pérez continued with the
      <br />Galácticos policy pursued in his first term buying Kaká from Milan
      for a <br />record-breaking (in pounds sterling) sum of £56 million,[84]
      and then <br />breaking the record again by purchasing Cristiano Ronaldo
      from Manchester <br />United for £80 million. [85] Real Madrid spent in
      excess of €261 million <br />
      in the summer of 2009, and the assembled team was soon dubbed the Second
      <br />Galácticos .[86] The 2009–10 season, however, was a transitional one
      as <br />Madrid again finished second in the league, although this time
      amassing 96 <br />
      points , the club's record at the time, and went out of the Champions
      <br />League at the hands of Lyon. The season was marred by Cristiano
      Ronaldo's <br />
      injury, that sidelined him for seven weeks, [87] although he still topped
      <br />the goalscoring charts with 33 goals, and Madrid became the highest
      <br />scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals. Real Madrid also had the
      <br />
      misfortune to become the runners-up with the highest points total in the
      <br />history of Europe's top five leagues, until surpassed by Liverpool's
      97 <br />
      points in 2018–19
