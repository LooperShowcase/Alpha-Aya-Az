After moving between several grounds, the team relocated to
 the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912, which remained its home 
 stadium for 11 years.[41] After this period, the club
  moved for one year to the Campo de Ciudad Lineal, a 
  small ground with a capacity of 8,000 spectators. After that,
   Real Madrid started playing its home matches at the Estadio Chamartín,
    which was inaugurated on 17 May 1923 with a match against Newcastle United
    .[196] In this stadium, which hosted 22,500 spectators, Real Madrid celebrated
     its first Spanish league title.[43] Following his election in 1943, president
      Santiago Bernabéu decided that the Chamartín was not big enough 
      for the ambitions of the club, and thus a new stadium was built
       and inaugurated on 14 December 1947.[52][197] Initially knows as Nuevo Chamartín,
        the stadium was renamed in honor of Bernabéu in 1955 and continues to bear his name to this day.
        [53] The first match at the Bernabéu was played between Madrid and the Portuguese club Belenenses,
         with Los Blancos winning 3–1 and Sabino Barinaga scoring the first goal.[52]
The capacity has changed frequently, peaking at 120,000 after a 1953 expansion.[198] Since then,
 there have been a number of reductions due to modernizations (the last standing areas were removed
  in 1998–99 in response to UEFA regulations which had forbidden standing at matches in European competitions)
   countered to some extent by expansions.[198] The latest capacity is 81,044 spectators. Real Madrid has the
    fourth-highest average attendance in Europe, behind Borussia Dortmund, Barcelona, and Manchester United.[199][200][201][202]
The Bernabéu has hosted the 1964 UEFA European Championship final, 
the 1982 FIFA World Cup final, and the 1957, 1969, 1980,
 and 2010 European Cup/Champions League finals.[203] The stadium has
  its own namesake Madrid Metro station along the 10 line.[204] On 14 November 2007,
   the Bernabéu was upgraded to Elite Football Stadium status by UEFA.[205]
On 9 May 2006, the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium, named after club legend Alfredo Di 
Stéfano, was inaugurated in the Real Madrid City, where Real Madrid usually trains.
 The inaugural match was played between Real Madrid and Stade de Reims,
  a rematch of the 1956 European Cup final. Real Madrid 6–1, with goals
   from Sergio Ramos, Antonio Cassano (2), Roberto Soldado (2), 
   and José Manuel Jurado. The venue is now part of the Ciudad Real Madrid
    the club's training facility located outside Madrid, in Valdebebas. 
    The stadium's capacity is 5,000 people, and it is Real Madrid Castilla's
     home ground.[206] For the latter part of the 2019–20 season and throughout the 2020–21 season,
      the stadium hosted the first team's home games due to a combination of the COVID-19 pandemic-triggered
       restrictions and an extensive renovation of the Santiago Bernabéu stadium.[207][208]
The latest renovation of the Santiago Bernabéu is set to increase the capacity by approximately 4,000 with the addition of an extra tier, 
bringing it to just over the 85,000 markFurthermore, the height will also be increased by ten metres and a retractable roof, a retractable pitch, and a 360-degree screen will be installed.[211][212] The works have started in 2019, and the renovated stadium was initially planned to be unveiled in 2022; however, the COVID-19 pandemic and Russian invasion of Ukraine caused significant disruption to supply chains,
 prompting the club to postpone the stadium's inauguration to 2023
